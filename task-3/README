Task 3 - optimization.

Your task is to find hot spots and propose optimizations so that the Dijkstra
algorithm implemented for this project runs faster. Familiarize youself and
experiment with the code - you freely modify the data structures in
task1.modifyme package.

The project implements a simple shortest path problem. Given:
 * a bidirectional graph and 
 * a list of points of interest as well as 
 * an upper time limit
it finds all the shortest paths between all the points of interest that are
below the given time limit.

Important:
  The final version of the project MUST NOT modify anything outside of the
  modifyme package and build.sbt! If you propose modifications make care to 
  make it compilable without touching anything in the `task1` package

For this task the priorities are
  1) being correct
  2) being fast
  3) being readable or extensible

(i.e being correct is more important than being fast, being fast is more
important than being readable or extensible)

Although one could probably spend a lot of time fine-tuning the data structures
here, you should strive for big improvements first. It should be possible to
substantially improve the runtime of the program in about 90 minutes of time. 

It's totally fine to spend more time then the stated 1.5hr but it's unnecessary
- follow up questions will be asked if we're in doubt.

Theoretical limits
  * The total possible limit will be <= 10800 (in [s] see Infinity.scala)
  * The amount of points of interest <= 1M
  * |V| and |E| of the graph         <= 10M

You can assume:
  * that neither of the above will be 0 
  * the graph won't have negative edges
  * the data input data is correct for in all relevant situations

Running:
  * Testing data is provided at 
      https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9rMR3RujiO4T1JrekxNRnBTVVU
  * it should be unpacked and the content of the `task1-test-data` should be
    placed in the project root directory. 
  * Use `sbt run` for a test run.
    * the default implementation is awfully slow and memory inefficient
      it might be prudent to use these settings:
      -Xmx12g -Xms512M -Xss512M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
      and even then the run on test data might NOT FINISH under 16 minutes. 
    * We provide several settings in the `Main.Settings` 
      * For the first couple of runs you might want to set the variable
        `Main.Settings.UseLessPois=true` until you find where the inefficiencies lie.
        with that flag the application should run fine under 6Gbs of memory
      * If you're on a machine with less than 12Gb of RAM you might want to set 
        `Main.Settings.UseGraph = GraphType.ReadSmall` - the program should work
         fine on 4Gb of RAM.
      * to skip loading the graph completely use `Main.Settings.UseGraph = GraphType.Constant`) 
        to profile issues unrelated to graph traversal

Tips and hints:
  * take a look at the implementation of Dijkstra and the calls it makes.
  * the provided implementations in modifyme package don't perform really well -
    the default data structures in the scala library won't be enough for
    peak performance
  * Evidence of `Infinity[Int]` is guaranteed to be equal to the time limit + 1. You can add
    to the constructors of your data structures if you want to leverage that knowledge.
  * it is totally fine to add any external dependencies for this project
  * time time spent on loading and writing the data is not counted in this task
  * `Dijkstra.apply` is called in parallel, but each call works on their own
    copies of the data - only the graph is shared. You can use this to your advantage.
  * think about data locality, boxing, garbage collection
