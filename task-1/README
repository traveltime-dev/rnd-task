Task 1 - review / safety

Your task is:

1) to go over the code in `review` package and propose modifications (either in
code or unambiguous comments) as well as the MOTIVATION for the change.

2) go over the scenarios in the `design` package and propose your
implementations

For this task the priorities are:
  1) being correct
  2) being readable and extensible

Speed is NOT important in this task - assume that the code in package is a top
level api, correctness NOT speed is paramount. 

The code that is WRONG for this task is such that we think it can cause the following problems
in the future:
  * The class is inadequate
  * The caller of the code can provide wrong arguments 
  * The caller of the code can get problematic return values
  * The maintainer may easily misunderstand the code
  * The maintainer may easily extend the code in a way that will no longer guarantee the correctness of the code
  * The maintainer may be easily misled about the typographical properties of the code
  * The code is not defensive enough.

Do not modify anything from the `donotmodify` package 
  - assume they're calls to libraries we do not control and cannot gurantee good
    behevaiour (think: native database implementations, external libraries we
    cannot vouch for. You can treat the comments as documentation).
  - the implementations are not provided - only the types and documentation

Tips and hints:
  * Each scenario is independent and presents the overall usage of the code in
    *reading* order
  * Each scenario has at least one glaring problem with it
  * You can include any external dependency if you wish.
