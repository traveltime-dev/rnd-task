  * There are three tasks each in it's own directory: task-{1,2,3}
  * The tasks were designed so that after reading the description they can be
    finished in 60-90 minutes each. 
    1) Taking MORE time is fine but unnecessary
    2) We understand that you might be busy so do not be afraid of
       committing a "not completed" task if you got stuck, as long as you're
       open to followup questions and can show the skills tested in those tasks 
       you should be fine
  * Read the README in each directory for further instructions.
